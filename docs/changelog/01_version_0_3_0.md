# Version 0.3.0

## New Features

- Added nested subdirectories support for the `docs` folder. Now you can organize your documentation in a more structured way.


## Limitations

- Only one level of subdirectories is supported. This means that you can't have a subdirectory inside another subdirectory. This is a known limitation and we are working to fix it in the next release.
