# Nice to Have

On this page, i will list some features that would be nice to have in the future. I'll write them down here so that i don't forget them. 


If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/padi2312/dorcs).

## General

- Use naming of the markdown files to generate items position
  - For example: `01_introduction.md`, `02_quick_start.md`, `03_usage.md`
  - Gets into: Introduction, Quick Start, Usage (in this order)
  - Dont need to specify the position in the metadata of the markdown files every time
- Starting the Dorcs with a `--watch` flag to automatically regenerate the documentation when a file changes

## Code Blocks

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Support for multiple languages
- Title for code blocks
- Line numbers for code blocks
- Copy to clipboard button for code blocks
- Expandable code blocks

## For starters

- Provide a starter template for the documentation
  - A simple and clean template to get started with
  - Should be automatically generated when running `dorcs` for the first time
