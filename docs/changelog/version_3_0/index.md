> The previous alpha versions of version 0.3.0 are still available in the [releases](https://github.com/padi2312/dorcs/releases) marked with `pre-release`.
> I don't recommend using them, as they are not stable and have some issues. 


**Note:** This release is a major rewrite of the frontend. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/padi2312/dorcs/issues).
