# Version 0.3.0 (Alpha 2)

## New Features

- Sections can now have a title and position in the sidebar.
- Support for a landing page when clicking on a section in the sidebar.

## Limitations

- When using a landing page for a section the section cannot be expanded in the sidebar.
- The subsections cannot get reached when using `index.md` **with** content in a section.
  - Using a `index.md` without content and **only** meta data will work as expected.
